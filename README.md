<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->
# Background

This repository contains analysis code for the publication, "Functional genomics provide key insights to improve the diagnostic yield of hereditary ataxia" (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.22276803v1), which applies functional genomic annotation to provide further insights into the genetic architecture of hereditary ataxia. 

All code relating to analysis of whole genome sequencing data of 100,000 Genomes Project participants are only available within the Genomics England Research Environment upon reasonable request from the authors.
